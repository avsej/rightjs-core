make the Element object have all the Element.Methods in static version, so it was possible to process 
elements faster, without actual extending (where possible).


make it possible to specify the start node for the element matching methods, so it was not get always
matched against the document node and was working faster.


handle the various css naming/values cases. Like opacity, filter, overflow etc.

do performance tests if it is worth to move the regexps in the String object into precompiled constants

add nice evalScripts/extractScripts methods for the String object.


try optimize the search with document.querySelector

remove unnecessary elements extention requests in the search/select process where it's possible.

there's seems to be a memory leaking problem in IE6, each run makes the test go slower. Investigate what's the problem.

investigate/patch String to support negative offsets

see if there's a fancier and more efficient way to test Element instance methods along with the static mirrors
