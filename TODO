Add observer lists of listeners support. Move the by name calls into the generic handler

Fix the build

Create alias #includes -> #include

Write tests for the Cookie unit

Think about moving part of the Array extensions to an Enumerable unit

Implement a Hash unit

String#escapeHTML #truncate  ???

handle the various css naming/values cases. Like opacity, filter, overflow etc.

there's seems to be a memory leaking problem in IE6, each run makes the test go slower. Investigate what's the problem.

see if you can shortify the Element static mirrors generation code.

Think about how to invoke the JavaScript 1.6 map/filter/??? methods

See how to get rid of evals in the Array#_call method

Element.addMethods

Observer#listeners

Observer self calls by name

Regexp#escape

Make Selector unit behave the same way as the native selectors do

Element#radio

add '&methodName' feature to the Array's collect/etc methods
[1,2,3].collect('methodName', [attributes])

try to optimize the search with document.querySelector

implement Array's 'walk' method

add nice evalScripts/extractScripts methods for the String object.

make the Element object have all the Element.Methods in static version, so it was possible to process 
elements faster, without actual extending (where possible).

make it possible to specify the start node for the element matching methods, so it was not get always
matched against the document node and was working faster.

remove unnecessary elements extention requests in the search/select process where it's possible.

see if there's a fancier and more efficient way to test Element instance methods along with the static mirrors
