RightJS
=======

We gonna make it right this time.



I Have a Dream
==============

A JavaScript framework which

 o) Compact by itself and allows others write a compact code
 o) Has a standard or at least predictable interface
 o) Offers excellent OOP abilities
 o) Contains only necessary stuff
 o) Works quickly and stable



The Call of Rightness
=====================

The project is pretty much an experiment. I just have that feeling
that I should write out some of my ideas, mix them up with ideas of
another people, which I find excellent and see what get happened.

This is just the call of rightness which leads us further.
Don't take it close for a while.
